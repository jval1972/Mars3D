{ A forward DCT routine is given a pointer to a work area of type DCTELEM[];
  the DCT is to be performed in-place in that buffer.  Type DCTELEM is int
  for 8-bit samples, INT32 for 12-bit samples.  (NOTE: Floating-point DCT
  implementations use an array of type FAST_FLOAT, instead.)
  The DCT inputs are expected to be signed (range +-CENTERJSAMPLE).
  The DCT outputs are returned scaled up by a factor of 8; they therefore
  have a range of +-8K for 8-bit data, +-128K for 12-bit data.  This
  convention improves accuracy in integer implementations and saves some
  work in floating-point ones.
  Quantization of the output coefficients is done by jcdctmgr.c. }

{ An inverse DCT routine is given a pointer to the input JBLOCK and a pointer
  to an output sample array.  The routine must dequantize the input data as
  well as perform the IDCT; for dequantization, it uses the multiplier table
  pointed to by compptr->dct_table.  The output data is to be placed into the
  sample array starting at a specified column.  (Any row offset needed will
  be applied to the array pointer before it is passed to the IDCT code.)
  Note that the number of samples emitted by the IDCT routine is
  DCT_scaled_size * DCT_scaled_size. }
